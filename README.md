# hottocold-bitcoin-bash-script

hottocold.sh is a bash script that transfers bitcoins from a wallet if the balance is more than a specific number/quantity

It was created by me for my client BitBandit.eu, who then released it as open source script/software for use of the community.  


Requirements


The script uses the calculator program named "dc", which is not standard in some systems, such as on Ubuntu. So you may need to install it separately.

It also needs the installation and setup of the bitcoin core software, specifically bitcoind and bitcoin-cli.
