# hottocold-bitcoin-bash-script

hottocold.sh is a bash script that transfers bitcoins from a wallet if the balance is more than a specific number/quantity

It was created by me for my client BitBandit.eu, who then released it as open source script/software for use of the community.  

The script used the calculator program dc, which is not standard in some systems, such as Ubuntu. So you may need to install it. 
It also needs the installation and setup of the bitcoin core software, specifically bitcoind and bitcoin-cli.
